The May issue of Kodansha's Monthly Shōnen Sirius magazine revealed last Saturday that Wataru Kajika will launch a new spinoff manga for Fuse and Mitz Vah's That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime (Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken) light novel series titled Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken: Clayman Revenge (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: Clayman Revenge) in the magazine's next issue on April 26. The manga centers on a new story about the Demon Lord Clayman.

Fuse serialized the story on the "Shōsetsuka ni Narō" (Let's Become Novelists) website from 2013 to 2016, and the series has since garnered over 400 million page views. Micro Magazine began publishing the series in print in 2014. The novels entered their final arc in the 18th volume in March 2021. Fuse also previously announced that he is considering writing side stories (spinoffs) after the current series is complete. Fuse is planning to end the series by its 22nd volume.
